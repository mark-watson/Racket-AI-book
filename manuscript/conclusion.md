# Conclusions


The material in this book was informed by my own work interests and experiences. If you enjoyed reading this book and you make practical use of at least some of the material I covered, then I consider my effort to be worthwhile.

Racket is a fun to use language that many people just use for fun personal projects. I have tried, dear reader, to make the case here that Racket can be a practical language that integrates well with my work flows on both Linux and macOS.

Writing software is a combination of a business activity, promoting good for society, and an exploration to try out new ideas for self improvement. I believe that there is sometimes a fine line between spending too many resources tracking many new technologies versus getting stuck using old technologies at the expense of lost opportunities. My hope is that reading this book was an efficient and pleasurable use of your time, letting you try some new techniques and technologies that you had not considered before.

If we never get to meet in person or talk on the telephone, then I would like to thank you now for taking the time to read my book.
