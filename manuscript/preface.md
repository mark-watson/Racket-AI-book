# Preface


The latest edition of this book is always available for purchase at [https://leanpub.com/clojureai](https://leanpub.com/clojureai).  You can also download a free copy from my website [https://markwatson.com](https://markwatson.com). You are welcome to take free copies of all of my eBooks and to share them. I offer the purchase option for readers who wish to directly support my work.

I have been developing commercial Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and applications since the 1980s and I usually use the Lisp languages Common Lisp, Clojure, Racket Scheme, and Gambit Scheme. This book contains code that I wrote for myself and I am wrapping it in a book in the hopes that my code and this book will also be useful to you, dear reader.

I wrote this book for both professional programmers and home hobbyists who already know how to program in Clojure and who want to learn practical AI programming and information processing techniques. I have tried to make this an enjoyable book to work through. In the style of a “cook book,” the chapters can be studied in any order. 

This book uses two of the examples in my Java AI book that is also available for purchase at [Leanpub.com](https://leanpub.com/javaai) and as a free download from my personal web site. I replicate these two bits of Java code in the GitHub repository for this book:

Git pull requests with code improvements will be appreciated by me and the readers of this book.

## Clojure, With Some Java and Python

To be clear, I actually like Common Lisp slightly more than Clojure, even though Clojure is a beautifully designed modern language and Common Lisp is ancient and has defects. Then why do I use Clojure? The Java ecosystem is huge and Clojure takes full advantage of Java interoperability. Just as I sometimes need access to the rich Java ecosystem I also need Python libraries for some of my projects. Here we will use the **libpython-clj** library for that. I also like the language **Hy** that has a Clojure-like syntax and wraps the Python language. If you use Python then my book [A Lisp Programmer Living in Python-Land: The Hy Programming Language](https://leanpub.com/hy-lisp-python) might be of interest.

Using the Java ecosystem is an important aspect of Clojure development and in the few cases where I use Java libraries from my Java AI book, my Clojure examples illustrate how to convert Clojure **seq** data to Java arrays, handle returned Java data values, etc.

## Personal Artificial Intelligence Journey: or, Life as a Lisp Developer

I have been interested in AI since reading Bertram Raphael’s excellent book *Thinking Computer: Mind Inside Matter* in the early 1980s. I have also had the good fortune to work on many interesting AI projects including the development of commercial expert system tools for the Xerox LISP machines and the Apple Macintosh, development of commercial neural network tools, application of natural language and expert systems technology, medical information systems, application of AI technologies to Nintendo and PC video games, and the application of AI technologies to the financial markets. I have also applied statistical natural language processing techniques to analyzing social media data from Twitter and Facebook. I worked at Google on their Knowledge Graph and I managed a deep learning team at Capital One where I was awarded 55 US patents.

I enjoy AI programming, and hopefully this enthusiasm will also infect you.
