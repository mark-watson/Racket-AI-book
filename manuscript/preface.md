# Preface

I have been using Lisp languages since the 1970s. In 1982 my company bought a Lisp Machine for my use. A Lisp Machine provided an "all batteries included" working environment, but now no one seriously uses Lisp Machines. In this book I try to lead you, dear reader, through a process of creating a "batteries included" working environment using Racket Scheme.

The latest edition of this book is always available for purchase at [https://leanpub.com/racket-ai](https://leanpub.com/racket-ai).  You can also read free online at [https://leanpub.com/racket-ai/read](https://leanpub.com/racket-ai/read). I offer the purchase option for readers who wish to directly support my work.

I have been developing commercial Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and applications since the 1980s and I usually use the Lisp languages Common Lisp, Clojure, Racket Scheme, and Gambit Scheme. This book contains Racket code that I wrote for my own use and I am wrapping it in a book in the hopes that my code and this book will also be useful to you, dear reader.

I wrote this book for both professional programmers and home hobbyists who already know how to program in Racket (or another Scheme dialect) and who want to learn practical AI programming and information processing techniques. I have tried to make this an enjoyable book to work through. In the style of a “cook book,” the chapters can be studied in any order. 

This book uses two of the examples in my Java AI book that is also available for purchase at [Leanpub.com](https://leanpub.com/javaai) and as a free download from my personal web site. I replicate these two bits of Java code in the GitHub repository for this book:

Git pull requests with code improvements will be appreciated by me and the readers of this book.

## Racket, Scheme, and Common Lisp

To be clear, I actually like Common Lisp slightly more than Racket and other Scheme dialects, even though Common Lisp is ancient and has defects. Then why do I use Racket?
Racket is a family of languages, a very good IDE, and a rich ecosystem supported by many core Racket developers and Racket library authors. Choosing Racket Scheme for this book was an easy decision, but to be fair there are also other Scheme dialects that I enjoy using:

- Gambit/C Scheme
- Gerbil Scheme (based on Gambit/C)
- Chez Scheme


## Personal Artificial Intelligence Journey: or, Life as a Lisp Developer

I have been interested in AI since reading Bertram Raphael’s excellent book *Thinking Computer: Mind Inside Matter* in the early 1980s. I have also had the good fortune to work on many interesting AI projects including the development of commercial expert system tools for the Xerox LISP machines and the Apple Macintosh, development of commercial neural network tools, application of natural language and expert systems technology, medical information systems, application of AI technologies to Nintendo and PC video games, and the application of AI technologies to the financial markets. I have also applied statistical natural language processing techniques to analyzing social media data from Twitter and Facebook. I worked at Google on their Knowledge Graph and I managed a deep learning team at Capital One where I was awarded 55 US patents.

I enjoy AI programming, and hopefully this enthusiasm will also infect you.
