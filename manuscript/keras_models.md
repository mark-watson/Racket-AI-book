Five years ago I was managing a deep learning team at Capital One and we used Keras with TensorFlow for almost all of our work. One weekend I wrote some simple Racket code to read a Keras model dump file and run it reasonably efficiently using a Racket linear algebra library for matrix operations. The example here is that code, cleaned up and modernized.
