# Mark Watson's Knowledge Graph Navigator ported to Racket

Test queries: who is Bill Gates?
              where is California?

## Work in Progress: this exaple works but not all features are implemented.

## Creating a standalone application

- Run the default Makefile target to run DrRacket with the local source files.
- Use the menu item Racket / Create Executable. When building executable on macOS, choose GRacket, not Racket to get *.app bundle
